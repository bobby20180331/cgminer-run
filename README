cgminer-run
===========

Running cgminer on linux

sem.c
-----
A program to keep a command of your choice always running on a linux computer
Simply create a script (see cgminer-cron.sh below), put it in crontab to
run every minute, and you're done

Compile with 'make sem'
cp -pv sem /usr/local/bin/

It will only allow the cgminer-cron.sh to be run once on a computer and if
cgminer-cron.sh crashes, gets killed or fails for some reason, it will release
the semaphore lock and the next run of it (within a minute) will start it again

cgminer-cron.sh
---------------
An example script to keep cgminer running
Read it and change it as necessary
Put it in /usr/local/bin
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cgminer-cron.sh

If your linux has an /etc/crontab then you can add it to crontab as:
* * * * * root screen -d -m -S cgm /usr/local/bin/cgminer-cron.sh
(or replace root with whatever other account you want to run cgminer)

If you use cronie or some other cron implementation that has a per user crontab
then use the command to edit your crontab file (e.g. crontab -e) and add
* * * * * screen -d -m -S cgm /usr/local/bin/cgminer-cron.sh

If the cgminer screen (cgm) doesn't appear after a couple of minutes it will
usually mean a permission error or a file not in the correct place or not +x
You can usually see what the problem is by running cgminer-cron.sh and it
should spit out the error that is causing it to fail i.e. run:
 /usr/local/bin/cgminer-cron.sh
then
 screen -ls
should list a cgm screen - if there were no problems or errors

Note that permission issues may stop it from running if you are running it in
cron as a different user to what you are logged in as and the permissions are
not setup to allow that user for all scripts and programs being used

cgminer.sh
----------
A sample cgminer run script to keep cgminer running and logging output
into your home directory
You either need a ~/.cgminer/cgminer.conf file with your settings and pools or
edit cgminer.sh to add your settings and pools
Don't forget to chmod +x cgminer.sh
